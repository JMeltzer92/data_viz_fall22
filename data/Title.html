    <div class="brief">
      <p>The above line graph shows a rise in hate crimes since 2017-2018, normalized by incidents per 100,000 population to avoid tiny decimal numbers. I focused on Western states, because these are typically seen as a bastion of liberal sentiment. I think the resulting visualization brings up some interesting observations: Oregon and Washington, typically the bluest states of the bunch, lead the pack. Idaho and Nevada, the traditionally more red states, are at the bottom, even though their numbers shot up a little in 2020.</p>
